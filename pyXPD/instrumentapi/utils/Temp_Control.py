This module handles the temperature control, for all the various furnaces, cryosystems, and resistive heaters.  The \
controllers which perform the PID function are dealt with separately from the actual heater/cryosystem.  This allows \
the limits for the individual heaters to be handled without changing the control configuration.  For integrated \
systems, like the cryostream, there will be two sections.

.. warning:: Only the Eurotherm serial port system has been implemented.  As long as the new controllers have \
PVs/interfaces have temperature ramp, current temperature, set temperature, and resolution attributes.  May need a \
slight re-write in order to accommodate a more generic PV based interface, also needs heater interfaces.

.. warning:: Currently uses a WHILE/SLEEP method for temperature position control, which needs to change

    ----------

            If this is not the current temperature go to the current temperature before starting run

    Ramp: float
        Ramp rate for the segment in C/min
            If this is None try to calculate ramp from stop and time
            If the calculation fails use default ramp
